# 🎸 AI Band Backend

**Created by Sergie Code - AI Tools for Musicians**

A Python backend for generating bass and drum tracks automatically from guitar input using AI models such as Magenta and Riffusion. The backend outputs MIDI files that can later be used in a DAW or audio plugin.

## 🎵 Project Overview

The AI Band Backend is the core engine of an intelligent music creation system that:

- **Analyzes guitar input** to detect chords, tempo, and musical key
- **Generates complementary bass lines** that follow the chord progression
- **Creates dynamic drum patterns** that match the musical style
- **Outputs professional MIDI files** ready for DAW integration
- **Provides a foundation** for real-time music generation and plugin development

### How It Works

```
Guitar Input → Chord Detection → AI Generation → MIDI Output
     ↓              ↓               ↓            ↓
Audio/MIDI → Chords + Tempo → Bass + Drums → .mid files
```

The pipeline consists of:

1. **Chord Detection**: Analyzes musical input to extract chord progressions and timing
2. **AI Generation**: Uses machine learning models to generate bass and drum parts
3. **MIDI Export**: Creates high-quality MIDI files for DAW integration

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Chord progression analysis** with tempo and key detection
- ✅ **Intelligent bass line generation** following musical theory
- ✅ **Dynamic drum pattern creation** with realistic velocity and timing
- ✅ **Professional MIDI output** compatible with all DAWs
- 🔄 **Extensible architecture** for adding more instruments
- 🎯 **AI-ready foundation** for Magenta and custom model integration
- 🔌 **Plugin-friendly design** for real-time processing

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sergiecode/ai-band-backend.git
   cd ai-band-backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   cd src
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Example

Run the main script to generate sample bass and drum tracks:

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

This will:
- Analyze a sample chord progression (C - Am - F - G)
- Generate a bass track that follows the chords
- Create a drum pattern that complements the progression
- Save MIDI files to the `output/` directory

### Example Output

```

🎉 AI Band Backend generation complete!
📁 Check the 'output' folder for your MIDI files
🎵 Import these files into your DAW to hear the magic!
```

### Using in Your Code

```python
from chord_detection import ChordDetector
from midi_generator import MidiGenerator

# Initialize components
detector = ChordDetector()
generator = MidiGenerator()

# Define chord progression
chords = [
    {"chord": "C", "start_time": 0.0, "duration": 2.0},
    {"chord": "Am", "start_time": 2.0, "duration": 2.0},
    {"chord": "F", "start_time": 4.0, "duration": 2.0},
    {"chord": "G", "start_time": 6.0, "duration": 2.0},
]

# Generate tracks
bass_midi = generator.generate_bass_track(chords, tempo=120)
drum_midi = generator.generate_drum_track(chords, tempo=120)

# Save files
bass_midi.save("my_bass.mid")
drum_midi.save("my_drums.mid")
```

## 🔧 Core Components

### ChordDetector (`chord_detection.py`)

Handles musical analysis and chord detection:

- **`detect_tempo()`**: Analyzes timing to determine BPM
- **`detect_key()`**: Identifies musical key from chord progression
- **`detect_chords_from_audio()`**: Placeholder for real-time audio analysis
- **`extract_features_for_ai()`**: Prepares data for AI model input

### MidiGenerator (`midi_generator.py`)

Generates MIDI tracks using musical intelligence:

- **`generate_bass_track()`**: Creates bass lines following chord progressions
- **`generate_drum_track()`**: Generates drum patterns with realistic dynamics
- **`combine_tracks()`**: Merges multiple instruments into single MIDI file
- **`generate_ai_bass_track()`**: Placeholder for AI-enhanced generation
